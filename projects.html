    <h3>Lab 1 - Temperature Sensor</h3>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>In this lab our team successfully developed a smart thermometer embedded system. This thermometer was capable of reading in live temperature data, which was displayed on a LCD and a computer, with a live graph. This Circuit was battery powered with a bluetooth module that connected to a computer. </p>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Pictured above is the user interface we designed for this thermometer. As the circuit transmits temperatures(via bluetooth), every one second, the data is read on the computer and plotted onto the graph. The "Toggle Unit" button allows users to toggle the unit that the temperatures are being printed in (C/F). The "Toggle Data" button allows users to turn on/off the LCD display connected to the circuit. The "Set Limits" button allows users to manually enter a min/max temperature threshold, that when reached, a specificed phone number will recieve a text, notifying them that their preset threshold has been reached.  </p>

    <h3>Lab 2 - Infared Reciever</h3>
    <div class="project-image">

    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>In this lab, our team developed an infared reciever that was designed to detect signals from a transmitter and filter out noise. In our case, when the reciever failed to detect a signal from the transmitter, a text message was sent to a designated phone number to notify them that the signal has been broken. For a practical use, this system could be used as a motion detector, that notifies the user when someone has walked through the signal that the transmitter is projecting onto the reciever. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Pictured above is the schematic for our reciever. As you can see, we created a bandpass filter cascaded with an amplifier which allowed us to read a clean, stable signal from the microcontroller that was used to send the text messages. </p>

    <h3>Lab 3 - This website!</h3>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>For lab 3, our team was tasked with creating this website! More specifically, we were tasked with developing web pages with images that could then be hosted on a public server so people could visit and view themselves. This website is a portfolio of the work that we have collaboratively completed throughout out Senior year.</p>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>For our Senior Design Project, our group will be creating a Point of Sales (POS) system for iPads. Although there are currently many different POS applications out there, we believe ours will have convenient improvements to existing applications. One of our improvements include allowing seamless change transactions by allowing customers to tap their phone to have the change from the transaction go straight to their bank accounts rather than receiving physical change. Additionally, our POS application will be able to help businesses implement loyalty programs, inventory tracking, customizable pay options, dynamic pricing, and allow them to schedule appointments if needed.</p>
